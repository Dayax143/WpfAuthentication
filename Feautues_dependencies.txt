For a client machine where you’ll install a setup of your WPF application containing these dependencies, here are the key requirements:

System Requirements
Operating System: Windows 10 or later (with support for WPF applications).

Processor: At least a dual-core processor (recommended: Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5).

RAM: Minimum 4GB, recommended 8GB or more for smooth performance.

Storage: At least 10GB free space for the application and database.

Software & Dependencies
.NET Runtime

Ensure that .NET 6 or later is installed for compatibility with your WPF application.

You can bundle the .NET Runtime with your installer if the client doesn’t have it.

Entity Framework Core

This requires a SQL Server instance on the client machine or an accessible database server.

If using local databases, SQL Server Express Edition is a lightweight option.

BCrypt.Net-Next

This library is used for password hashing, so no extra setup is needed—it just runs with your app.

Windows Desktop Runtime

Since your application is WPF-based, it needs the Microsoft WindowsDesktop.App framework (which is included with .NET).

Additional Dependencies

Microsoft analyzers, logging generators, and any third-party NuGet packages referenced in your solution should either be bundled in the installer or included via dependency management.

Network & Firewall Considerations

If your app connects to a database remotely, ensure the required ports (e.g., SQL Server default port 1433) are open.

If using inter-VLAN routing, configure network rules to allow database access between departments.
